### Installation

Rust uses a command line tool called `rustup` for the installation inside the system.

If the installation is successfully, you should have the next message inside the console.

```bash
Rust is installed now. Great!
```

I follow the chapter one in the [Rust Book 1. Installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html)
